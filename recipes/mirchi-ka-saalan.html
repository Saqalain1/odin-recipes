    <h1>Mirchi Ka Saalan</h1>
    <p>Hyderabadi Mirchi Ka Salan is a rich, tangy, and aromatic curry from Hyderabad, traditionally served with biryani. The key to its unique flavor lies in the roasted peanut-sesame-coconut paste and slow-cooked tamarind-based gravy, which gives it a balanced spicy, sour, and nutty taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup raw peanuts</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
        <li>¼ cup desiccated or dry coconut (copra)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp poppy seeds (khuskhus)  optional</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>7–8 dried red chilies (optional, for depth) </li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander seeds </li>
        <li>1 inch ginger, chopped </li>
        <li>4–5 garlic cloves </li>
        <li>Water, as needed </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry roast peanuts, sesame seeds, coconut, poppy seeds, cumin, coriander seeds, and red chilies (if using) in a pan over medium heat until golden and aromatic. Cool completely.</li>
        <li>Grind the roasted ingredients into a smooth paste with ginger, garlic, and a little water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry green chilies. Slit them lengthwise, deseed carefully, and keep stems intact.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan and fry the chilies on medium-low heat until blistered and soft. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>In the same oil, add mustard seeds, cumin, nigella, fenugreek (if using), and curry leaves. Let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ground masala paste and cook on low heat, stirring continuously, for 8–10 minutes until the oil begins to separate.</li>
        <li>Add tamarind pulp, chopped tomato (if using), salt, jaggery, and 1½–2 cups water. Mix well and simmer for 15–20 minutes until the gravy thickens and oil floats on top.</li>
        <li>Gently add the fried chilies and simmer for another 5–10 minutes so they absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with Hyderabadi biryani, plain rice, or roti.</li>
