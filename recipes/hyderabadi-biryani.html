    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, combine green chilies, ginger, garlic, coriander leaves, and mint leaves with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend into a coarse paste, scraping the sides as needed.</li>
        <li>Wash the mutton thoroughly and drain well. In a large bowl, mix the mutton with yogurt, green paste, fried onions, salt, lime juice, oil, and biryani masala powder. Ensure even coating. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Soak the aged Basmati rice for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Drain completely and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add whole spices (cloves, cinnamon, black cardamom, green cardamom, bay leaf, and shahi jeera) and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the soaked rice and stir gently. Add 8 cups of water, salt (slightly more than a good soup), and the remaining spices. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cook until rice is 80% done (grains should be tender but not mushy)</li>
        <li>Drain the rice immediately in a colander and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In the Dutch oven, layer the marinated mutton evenly, starting with larger pieces at the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>Spread half of the cooked rice evenly over the mutton. Sprinkle half of the saffron milk, 1 teaspoon garam masala, fried kishmish, cashews, and chopped coriander and mint leaves over the rice.</li>
        <li>Layer the remaining rice on top. Repeat the seasoning: saffron milk, garam masala, herbs, and fried onions.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot tightly with aluminum foil, then seal the lid. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 45 minutes, then reduce temperature to 300°F (150°C) and bake for another 50–60 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and let the biryani rest for 15 minutes before opening the lid. </li>
        <li>Gently mix the rice and mutton together to combine flavors without breaking the grains. </li>
    </ol>
